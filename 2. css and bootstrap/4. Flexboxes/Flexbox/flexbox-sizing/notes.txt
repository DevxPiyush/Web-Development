In the flexbox sizing thing

by default:
max width = the size of longest sentence
min width = the size of longest word in any paragraph (even the shortest one sentence can have it too)

content width < width < flex-basis < min-width/max-width 

way to write the flex basis,shrink and basis?
flex: 1 1 0
pehla wala 1 = flex grow is on
dusra wala 1 = flex shrink is on
pehla wala 1 = flex basis is off
1 pe on and 0 pe off hota hai
